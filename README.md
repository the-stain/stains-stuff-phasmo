Remake #2: Phasmophobia

The second project in my remake series (where I recreate mechanics/puzzles/etc. from video games). My goal here is to recreate the Thermometer from Phasmophobia.

### Post-mortem

I am stopping work on this project. Not because it's finished -- on the contrary, it's not even near completion -- but because I've made the decision that I should.

Why?

First, my goal with these projects is to learn about game development by figuring out how to recreate mechanics from other games. Here, my primary objective was to recreate the mechanics behind the Thermometer and how it detected temperatures. I actually did accomplish this, so my goal was technically complete.

Second, I struggle greatly with "particularism". In creative endeavors, "perfection" is always a subjective factor; it can never be objective because there is no single rule defining quality that is universally true. What people try to call perfectionism is, in fact, particularism: the attempt to create in a particular way, accomplish particular goals, and so on. My particularism was triggered by my over-ambitious secondary objective to recreate the Thermometer in a particular way -- with Scriptable Objects. What I thought would be an interesting challenge basically doomed the project because I became more and more particular about how to implement things with those Scriptable Objects.

This isn't to say that they're the problem; I think SOs are amazing, which is why I wanted to use them. The problem was with me. I couldn't control my compulsion to add more and more rules to my implementation based on what I felt was ideal. So, for my own sake, I'm making an executive decision to stop. I could come back to this at a later time, but I probably won't. 

On the bright side, I learned a ton of new things from this project. I used an interface for the first time -- albeit only because I was using someone else's code, but I still got to see it in action! I practiced writing scripts in a way that was more amenable to composition as opposed to trying to write with just inheritance in mind. And I learned about Raycast stuff... a bit. So I still benefitted from the experience overall.

With that said, I'm gonna go figure out what to remake next -- and hopefully not fall into the same trap this time :3
